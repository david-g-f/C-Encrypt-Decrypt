# C project for encrypting and decrypting files. 
A little practical project I will work on using the C programming language in order to further my understanding of the language.

## How the program works
The program uses a rudimentary technique of subtracting the ASCII value of each character by a random number. The decryption works similarly by instead adding that same amount.
